# Skip Hire UI â€“ Modern and User-Friendly Interface

---

## Overview

This project is a complete redesign of an older "skip hire" application that initially had a complex and confusing user interface. The new version focuses on simplicity, clarity, and modern design principles, ensuring a seamless experience across all screen sizes.

## Improvements Made During Development

- The original UI was confusing and overwhelming. I restructured it to be cleaner, more intuitive, and modern.
- The color palette was updated to be more formal and visually balanced.
- Skip cards were redesigned for clarity and ease of selection. Each card includes visual elements and clear information.
- Since the provided API endpoint did not return image data, I manually created an image array to represent each skip visually.
- The entire application is responsive and works flawlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- I implemented a filtering feature using the RC-Slider library, allowing users to filter skips by size and price range.
- The project uses a component-based architecture, making it scalable and easy to maintain.
- Context API was used for managing state between components.

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- React.js
- React Hooks
- Tailwind CSS
- HTML5 & CSS3
- ContextAPI
- Axios (for API requests)
- RC-Slider (for filtering)
